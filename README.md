A splash page.

# Basic requirements

## User stories

🐿️ As a user, I want the web page to have a clear structure with a recognisable header, footer, and navigation sections, so that I can easily navigate and understand the content.
🐿️ As a user, I want the layout and navigation links to be responsive and well-organised, so that I can easily access and interact with the website.
🐿️ As a user, I want to see text overlaid on images or other elements in a visually appealing way, so that the content is engaging and enhances my browsing experience.
🐿️ As a user, I want images to load correctly and be displayed properly on the web page, so that my viewing experience is seamless and visually pleasing.

## Requirements

🎯 Ensure each section of the webpage is wrapped in the correct semantic tags, ensuring that includes a <header>, <nav>, and <footer>.
🎯 Implement CSS absolute positioning to overlay text on an image or another element.
🎯 Utilise CSS Flexbox to create a flexible and responsive layout, particularly in the <nav> element.
🎯 Ensure all image elements (<img>) are correctly implemented with accurate src file paths.

## 🎯 What requirements did I achieve?

This week, I was able to achieve all the minimum requirements for this project:

- I created a wireframe and a high fidelity design and was able to translate this into code using the correct tags for each section
- I used CSS absolute positioning to place different illustrations on different parts of the page, as well as some favourite buttons for the products in the shop section
- I created a flexible layout using flexbox, with a clear navbar and wrapping elements across the whole site.
- I included several images, all of the correctly implemted and functioning.

# Stretch Goals

## Stretch User Stories

🐿️ As a user, I want to have a “back to top” button so that I can easily return to the top without manually scrolling.
🐿️ As a user, I want smooth scrolling for internal links so that I can have a seamless and enjoyable navigation experience within the website.
🐿️ As a user, I want buttons to have a hover effect so that they appear more interactive and I can easily identify clickable elements.
🐿️ As a user, I want a basic footer with social media icons that link to social media pages so that I can easily connect with the website on social platforms.
🐿️ As a user, I want a background music track that plays automatically when the website loads so that I can have an enhanced and enjoyable browsing experience.

## 🎯 What requirements did I achieve?

This week, I was able to achieve all the stretch requirements for this project and included some more:

- I created a back to top button
- I implemented smooth scrolling
- All my links and buttons have a hover effect for better UX
